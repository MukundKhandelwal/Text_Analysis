# Text_Analysis

This project was a part of my coursework DS 501 (Introduction to Data Science).
In this project, we performed text analysis on the v2.0 Polarity Dataset, consisting of 2,000 textual movie reviews, to predict whether a review is positive or negative.
Additionally, we applied dimension reduction techniques to plot visualizations separating bipolar reviews in a 2-D space.
